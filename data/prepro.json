A native of Bulgaria, Mr. Mladenov trained in the Vaganova Method at the National School of Ballet in Sofia, Bulgaria, from 1984 to 1993. In 1997 he earned a B.A. degree from the National Academy of Music in Sofia, Bulgaria. His honors and awards include Laureate of Arabesque Competition and the prize for best performance in P.I. Tchaikovskys Sleeping Beauty, Perm, Russia (1998), Laureate of Masako Ohya World Ballet Competition, Osaka, Japan (1995), prize for Best Partner in seniors category at the National Ballet Competition, Dobritsch, Bulgaria, and a nomination for the prestigious award, “Crystal Lire,” in the field of performing arts. Mr. Mladenov first came to America as a dancer and Ballet Master at the University of Texas in El Paso, under the directorship of Ingeborg Heuser. He assisted choreographer Kathryn Posin and danced the lead in her production of Scheherazade, at Milwaukee Ballet. Mr. Mladenov has been Assistant Director of the Syracuse University Summer Dance Intensive, under the artistic leadership of Danita Emma. In 2010, Mr. Mladenov founded Cultural Bridges Association with its mission to expand the repertoire of Bulgarian ballet and enhance its standing by introducing the dancers to the diverse range of American Ballet. As the first project in 2011, Cultural Bridges presented The Suzanne Farrell Ballet and the National Ballet of Bulgaria in a shared program titled Balanchine and Farrell: American Ballet for Bulgaria at the National Opera House in Sofia, Bulgaria. In 2012, the second program featured Balanchine’s famed La Source performed by The National Ballet of Bulgaria dancers. In both projects, Mr. Mladenov choreographed and premiered two new ballets for the National Opera and Ballet of Bulgaria. Cultural Bridges 3 rd project of American Ballet for Bulgaria 2013 was of their most ambitious projects to date. The program included works of George Balanchine, William Forsythe and Jerome Robbins performed by National Ballet of Bulgaria with a special featured performance of Ailey II.
